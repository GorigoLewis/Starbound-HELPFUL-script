# Easy script to mod starbound server
## **About**
### **Starbound Powershell powered script** - which allows starbound modpack creators/mod makers to automatically rename their mods by using steam workshop folder, for example if you are mod creator and trying to test your project with other 50+ mods, or youre modpack creator with over 100+ mods you can just use this script so you can automatically start procedure of renaming all contents.pak without touching other files like fullbright/chucklefish forum mods or nexus mods ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bea975a-48db-4535-8180-cba0163adfd1) like those, you can also update your server mods by using starbound mod manager keys, so if you havent played in a while, just use this script to delete old mods, and download them again, server launches automatically and log shows in case some mods are problem

### Summary 

> Each 100 mods of manual installation take 30 minutes so for example 500 mods take couple hours, this script makes it so you can unpack/update mods in just couple minutes (depends on pc specs like hdd/ssd and amount of mods)


### THIS SCRIPT WONT DELETE OLD MODS/FOLDERS (like fullbright or etc mods you got from forum/workshop which require manual installation, so be happy this script is OP)

### How to start?
1. Download both files, put them in Starbound\win64 or win34 (the folder where you have starbound.exe and starboundserver.exe)
2. Open the Starbound_Mod_Server_Manager.bat and specify your Starbound, Steam, starbound_server.exe location
